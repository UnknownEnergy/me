# Daniel Schweiger 👨‍💻 - Senior Software Developer

Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a Senior Software Developer with over 7 years of experience in developing software solutions for various industries. I am passionate about building robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems that solve real-world problems. 

## Projects 🚀

Here are some of the projects that I have worked on:

### Project 1: Chat Worm - Advanced Chat GPT Client 💰

I am working on a project called www.chatworm.com, which is a web client for ChatGPT. This tool has multiple advantages, including availability even when the original chat platform is down, faster response time, and cost-effectiveness as users only pay per tokens. Additionally, the application is customizable, which lets users change the randomness of AI assistant's responses, and it offers multiple models, including those with no content policy. Along with all these features, Chatworm.com offers many more features that make it a versatile and useful tool for anyone looking for an AI assistant for chatting. And the best thing it is open-source.
